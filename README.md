# Reversi-reinforcement-learning
RL approach to learning the strategy of the classic game Reversi from scratch

Reversi is a board game where players take turns putting stones on the board.
By putting the stone on the board player can (and must, according to the rules)
surround opponent stones in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction thus
flipping them. The goal of the game is to flip as many stones as possible to your
own color and at the end of the game have more stones of your color than your opponent.
To quickly familiarize with the rules one can play a game online
at, for example, http://www.webgamesonline.com/reversi/

Stage 1
At this stage the program has been training for 2 days (using PyPy3) and has played around 200.000 games.
Half of these games are stored in a file of 100MB, however github does not allow big files
to be stored.
